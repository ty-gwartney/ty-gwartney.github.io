Many people respond positively to the idea of smashing a computer. There are countless cartoons and images online relating the experience; try a simple search of “computer trouble”, “computer help”, or anything similar. In fact, I just discovered there is already a technical term for the phenomenon: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_rage">Computer rage</a>. How can that be? They are still rather expensive, so common sense seems to imply people would shudder at the idea of destroying one, like wrecking a car. Instead, it’s wickedly appealing. Why?

The answer is easy: computers are complex. We constantly hear how powerful they are, and we’ve all been sold on the notion that computers are the key to the future. Knowing the inner-workings of the computer is immensely valuable, but still a rare commodity. Thus, we are at the mercy of our more-learned peers: the relatively small group people who tinker with software and hardware all day, perhaps professionally. Only they have the power to rescue us from our dilemma, but there is a problem: they’re in high demand, and their time is limited. How can we convince them to help us instead of someone else?

Fortunately, Eric Raymond has written us a guide for exactly that: how to approach technology circles with inquiries effectively. It basically boils down to a set of simple ideas: before you ask for help, try and find the answer yourself (or if the question has already been asked) and when you do ask, be specific about your issue, provide the necessary details, mention what you’ve already tried, and act with courtesy. This is useful information for anyone who just needs a one-time fix, but it’s particularly important for future developers. Getting technical help from an expert could be a matter of remaining employed or getting fired, and for open-source developers, being seen as a valuable contributor as opposed to a troll.

This brings me to Exhibit A,
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-do-i-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-on-linux/16957078#16957078">a properly conceived question.</a>
The question is clearly stated in the header. The questioner appears to be new to using a Unix-like command line, and instead of simply asking vaguely “How do I do X?” they explain their purpose, and post what they’ve found on their own, indicating they’ve at least made their own effort to resolve their issue. They then go on to post what command they used, and explain why it’s not what they are looking for.  Many of the responses (of which there are many) offer alternatives with clarifications of functionality, which is very helpful for beginners (some of the manual entries are a bit cryptic).

Conversely, we have Exhibit B, 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42632806/basic-c-pointer-declaration-and-pointer-variable-im-confused-over">an improperly conceived question.</a>
This code posted seems almost certainly to be a homework assignment, probably something like “To check for basic understanding of syntax in C, add comments to these different lines of code, explaining what they do”. A few of the responses are as predicted: “What is your specific problem? We are not a tutoring site. All your question will be answered by a C book.” The questioner appears to want the correct answer only to finish the assignment, not to learn on their own. The question itself isn’t even posted until after all of the code and comments, at the bottom of the text, and the header does not make sense.

Resolving a computer issue is like finding a little sprinkle of gold in a river bed, especially after panning unsuccessfully for an extended period of time. Instead of always going alone, sometimes it’s best to go with an expert, someone who knows the river by heart and where the gold is most likely to be. Learning a new technology is no different: we all need guidance from time to time. For an open-source software developer, seeking and providing help is at the core of the community.
