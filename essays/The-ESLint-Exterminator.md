There’s been a growing video category on the internet the last few years: the “satisfying” video. If that sounds weird, it’s because it is. Many of these videos belong to the “gross out” genre: popping giant pimples, draining blood from cauliflower-ed ears, squeezing out mango worms from pets. They sound disgusting… what’s so satisfying about watching things like that? Well, it isn’t the content of the videos that the “satisfying” refers to, but the feeling one has seeing an ugly problem resolved.

For me, cleaning up messy code brings a similar feeling of satisfaction. I’ve spent hours and hours looking for bugs in my programs, some to no avail. The easy bugs are syntax mistakes, like a missing bracket or a misspelled variable, and fixing them is like squashing a mosquito. The harder bugs are logical mistakes, usually hidden from plain site. They wait patiently in the background, waiting to sting until the right moment, like an angry wasp.

Fortunately, modern IDE’s can easily assist in fumigating programs of all kinds of bugs via enforcing coding standards on projects. ESLint is a tool that does exactly that: it watches over your shoulder as you type, constantly nudging you for any and every little irregularity that shows up. While slightly pesky and a bit of a hassle to deal with, the resulting code will almost certainly be more operational and comprehensible, particularly for other people working under the same standard. Imagine trying to fit together a set of different files written by different people, all in their own, unique style, into a single coherent program: it would be a mess, and trying to patch it all together would take forever.

Instead, just apply the ESLint bug spray at the beginning, and save the time spent debugging on design and more important things. Sure, it’s a nuisance, but it assists greatly in one of the top priorities for a software engineer: finishing the program. After all, for a developer, there is nothing more satisfying than completing a fully-working program.
