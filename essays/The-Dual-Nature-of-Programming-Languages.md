I made a conscious decision last year not to take sides in any tech debates over programming languages, operating systems, IDEs and such, partly because I'm something of an outsider to the field without a very strong frame of reference, and partly because many of these debates devolve in to hostility. Instead, I prefer to simply take what people say they like and dislike about something into consideration in order for effective use in the future. Depending on who you ask, the same quality of Java can be positively said to be "flexible" while negatively said to be "slippery", or with C, "structured" versus "rigid", and C++, "powerful" as opposed to "complicated", and in different ways, they are all understandable. Surely a similar pair of adjectives can describe Javascript.

It seems like every language I've studied so far has good and bad qualities, and each has been designed to meet a particular need. Javascript seems to go for accessibility and simplicity. Instead of a batch of variable types to learn and distinguish, we are given "let" for everything, which is convenient but perhaps a bit reckless. I feel it helps declutter the program design process, but I also think it could lead to confusion in the debugging process (or vice versa). I will need more experience to be sure, but I remain optimistic. However, I have found working with objects to be confusing so far, especially the quotation marks around everything. It seems unnecessary, but I'm willing to wait until I get used to it to totally denounce it.

As I mentioned, Javascript seems to be designed with simplicity in mind, allowing for clear code to be written quickly and effectively. This makes it an ideal language for learning new concepts with, as there is no need to dig down into technical jargon to write functioning programs.

Regarding the athletic approach to software engineering, I find it to be stressful, but that doesn't bother me as I actually think stress can be a good thing. I understand stress can have negative effects on the body, but at the same time it can incentivize someone to take action to better their situation. So while doing the timed exercises is uncomfortable, learning to think under pressure is a positive outcome, so it's worth it. I imagine the timed exercises as basically job-interview preparation, the kind of preparation it would be hard to take seriously if I were studying by myself, as I'm sure I would go much easier on myself than a company would. In the long run, I think it will be beneficial, as a personal goal of mine is to be able to solve similar programming problems very quickly anyway.
