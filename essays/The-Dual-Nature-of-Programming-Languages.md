I made a conscious decision last year not to take sides in any tech debates over programming languages, operating systems, IDE's and such, partly because I'm something of an outsider to the field without a very strong frame of reference, but also because people with excessively strong opinions tire me, and there seems to be no shortage of such people in the technology world (or anywhere else). Depending on who you ask, the same quality of Java can be positively said to be "flexible" while negatively said to be "slippery", or with C, "structured" versus "rigid", and C++, "powerful" as opposed to "complicated", and in different ways, they are all understandable. Surely a similar pair of adjectives can describe Javascript.

It seems like every language I've studied so far has good and bad qualities, and each has been designed to meet a particular need. Javascript seems to go for accessibility and simplicity. Instead of a batch of variable types to learn and distinguish, we are given  "let " for everything, which is convenient but perhaps a bit reckless. I feel it helps declutter the program design process, but I also think it could lead to confusion in the debugging process (or vice versa). I will need more experience to be sure, but I remain optimistic. However, I have found working with objects to be confusing so far, especially the quotation marks around everything. It seems unnecessary, but I'm willing to wait until I get used to it to denounce it.

Regarding the athletic approach to software engineering, I find it to be stressful, but that doesn't bother me as I actually think stress can be a good thing. I imagine the timed exercises are basically job-interview preparation, the kind of preparation it would be hard to take seriously if I were studying by myself, as I'm sure I would go much easier on myself than a company would. It's also a new way of learning for me, which I'm happy to experience. In the long run, I think it will be beneficial, as a personal goal of mine is to be able to solve similar programming problems very quickly anyway.
