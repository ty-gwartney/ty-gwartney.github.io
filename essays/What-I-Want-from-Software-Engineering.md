I'm in something of a transitional phase in my life, moving from my current physically laborious job (a shipping clerk) to one more cerebral (an IT professional), and the adjustment has not been easy. I've taken the early steps, learned the basics of computer programming and computation, and I've arrived at the next level: Software Engineering. The phrase itself is impressive. Hearing it, I imagine an army of well-trained programmers typing away on laptops and drawing incomprehensible schematics on dry-erase boards. It's an intimidating thought, considering my personal experience with computer programming thus far, which is shallow, but it's also something of an intriguing thought: someday, I would like to become one of those programmers. However, the road ahead is long and arduous, and since I’m still relatively new to the whole field, it’s hard to be certain of any specific goal I want to achieve or skill I wish to become proficient in, but I can conceive of some things from the outset that seem important to focus on.

The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear Software Engineering is teamwork. I’ve often wondered how it’s possible that a group of different, unique individuals, each with their own work style and coding preferences, could create a single, fully functioning, well-tested program that does what it’s supposed to. This is something I look forward to exploring and experiencing myself firsthand, both from the perspective of an individual team member, working on a specific aspect of a program, as well as someday from the managerial side, overseeing an entire project. The ability to understand the ideas of other programmers as they themselves understand them seems to be a rewarding skill, but it seems to be the kind of thing that can only be gained through experience, which I'm lacking.

Something else I’m interested in improving is my adaptability to new technologies, which studying Software Engineering seems ideal for developing. Learning any new profession requires learning the “tools of the trade”, so to speak, and in this particular field, the tools seem immense, and growing in complexity. Rather than being intimidated by new technologies, or overwhelmed by them when faced with having to learn a new one, I hope instead to learn to learn better, and to acquire the patience and focus needed to read through the details carefully. It's something I've always struggled with, the impulse to rush ahead before I'm fully prepared. Being put in a situation where the details matter more will hopefully force me to change.

Regardless of whether or not I'm able to develop these areas while learning about Software Engineering, I can say with a degree of certainty that whatever I do develop will be useful. It's great when one can generalize a new set of skills and apply them to other areas, even when there is not a clear connection present. Fortunately, that's exactly how programming and software seem to work, by applying specific ideas from the real world to a virtual environment, so I'm looking forward to what lies ahead.
