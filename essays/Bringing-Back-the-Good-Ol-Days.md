My phone is four or five years old, but still going strong. The only thing that really stands out as "dated" is the browser. It loads most newer pages a lot slower than other phones, and it heats up when playing music, but it works great loading old-fashioned websites that are just basic HTML with a little CSS styling, like class websites. Because of this, I've grown to prefer the 1990's era of web design to what we have now. Modern webpages look much nicer, and are much more varied and have more capabilities, but they are weighed down by all the extra code.

Because of this, I've been slow going into learning much about web design. Just looking at the source code for many websites feels like staring at gibberish. Even simple sites can be monstrous: this past week I spent around 10-15 minutes trying to find the link to a background image for a local bar, even after inspecting it directly with Chrome tools. This should only take two seconds, but it was so deeply buried in the wreckage that my only option was to click every link in the code until I found it.

Fortunately, the chances of this happening again are low. It seems design frameworks like Semantic UI, which make creating modern websites much easier and practical, are the way of the future. Comparing the code of a copy of a real website I wrote with Semantic UI to it's real source code was striking: they are almost the same website, but one with clear and readable code, and the other a barrage of static and noise. While I have yet to try, I imagine loading a website written with Semantic UI on my phone would be faster than loading the same page without it.

So in a way, it's kind of like bringing back the old days in a modern form. I don't have to spend the rest of my life reminiscing about how much cleaner and easier the 90's websites were, since modern websites are shaping up that way too, but with all the advancements since then. I look forward to experimenting more with these web frameworks, and hopefully I'll be able to get a few more years out of my phone.
