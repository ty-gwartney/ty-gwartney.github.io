summary: I've been teaching myself piano since 2015.

I took piano lessons when I was younger, but I never made much progress and did not advance to any real level of proficiency, something which I've regretted since then. In 2015, I decided to purchase a MIDI-controller piano keyboard, and use piano emulators to re-learn piano. I barely remembered how to read music, which I had also learned playing in my elementary school and middle school orchestras, so I wasn't a total beginner when I started, and was able to pick up close to where I left off quickly.

Since sheet music is widely available online, at all levels of difficulty, I'm able to search for music that fits my current skill level quite easily, and I also have some songbooks that I practice from frequently. This entirely an individual effort.

Learning to play piano has taught me to learn concisely in a step-by-step, note-by-note way, and given me some self-confidence for learning new things in general. I've also developed my sense of self-discipline, forcing myself to practice even when I don't feel up for it. I've also learned to take care with the "boring" aspects of learning something new, such as basic scales and such, things that have no immediate measurable value but are essential to building speed and proper technique. This is an ongoing project of mine, and I do not plan to stop; it is more or less a permanent part of my life for now. I have no interest in becoming a professional, I just enjoy having a routine hobby I can always return to.
