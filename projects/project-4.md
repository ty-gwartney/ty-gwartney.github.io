For my Software Engineering class, I worked in a small group of three people on a miniature social network called "Recruiting Grounds" designed for students seeking employment and employers seeking recruits. The original plan was to have separate accounts for students and businesses, and allow users to post information about themselves or their organization and what they were looking for, in an attempt to make the job-placement process easier for students and employers. We used a basic project React/Meteor template and modified it to fit our own ideas, according to the guidelines of the assignment. Our code repository can be visited <a href="https://github.com/twt-connections/recruiting-grounds">here</a>, and a link to our project home page can be found <a href="https://twt-connections.github.io/">here</a>.

Aside from my share of coding, my roles in the project were primarily that of a coordinator and planner. By coordinator, I mean the person who tried to keep everyone up-to-date and on the same page, and by planner, I mean the person who provided some long-range perspective on our project, as in what kind of functionality it should include, and how the site should be organized hierarchically. I also spent time helping debug the project at different stages of development. As far as coding is concerned, I made some of our initial mockup pages, including an unused Admin page, the current landing page, as well as the Browse Listings page and the associated collection.

While working on this project, I learned a bit about databases and how they are implemented for websites and online applications, as well as some React and Meteor syntax. I also learned what can go wrong when merging to a master branch on GitHub, as at one point, there might have been two versions of master in existence. It seems like the project would work on one of our local environments (mine or my teammates'), while crashing on another... we never discovered the actual cause, but having two separate versions of master as a result of using multiple accounts for a single user on GitHub seems to imply there might have been multiple versions of master.
